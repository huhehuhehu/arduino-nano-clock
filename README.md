# arduino-nano-clock
Just the program for a digital clock I made. Included photos and videos of it. Was made back in 2017.

Made with Arduino Nano as the main controller. Designed with my favorite pokemon, Gengar, as inspiration, including Ghastly, Haunter, and its Mega form.
Design edited with corelDraw, and then laser cut.

Here's the final result:

Originally did not include the front opaque acrylic plate, but added it because even at minimum brightness, the LED was way too bright at night.
